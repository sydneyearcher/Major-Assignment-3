            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> My name is Sydney Archer. I grew up in New York and have been in Florida for almost five years now. I
                really enjoy reading books, collecting vinyls, and going out to eat. I also really enjoy music, and art
                and different genres in art. I also really enjoy fashion, interior design and take interest in culinary
                arts. I am hoping to showcase enough of that art in this website to give the user
                enough of a feel of what my direction in design is. I am
                a second year at University of Central Florida. I study the Digital Media
                Major and am currently in the Web Design track. This site was made to highlight my academic journey and
                the inspirations behind my ideas of Web Design.

            <h3>My Academic Journey</h3>
            <p>I feel like my academic journey really started around middle school. I feel that I started to truly begin
                to focus and think about my academia and future around 8th and 9th grade. In the 8th grade, I originally
                wanted to go into a degree in Architecture. I actually even got the chance to intern at an actual
                Architecture Firm, that happened to be working on a project in City Hall in Downtown. During this
                internship I got the oppurtunity to see the process of meetings for the team discussing ideas for
                features in the Town Hall, along with the everyday routines of each of the employees that worked at the
                firm. I also got to explore a bit of Downtown Orlando which was relatively new to me since I had just
                moved to Orlando around that time.
            </p>

            <h3>My Academic Journey Cont'd</h3>
            <p>Alas, while the experience was enjoyable, it was eye opening. After sitting in on critiques that students
                had to go through each semester, I quickly realized that this degree would be a pretty difficult one to
                pursue. While I know nothing good comes easy, the combination of having to learn the arts and apply it
                to math and engineering made me realize it was something I couldn't see myself doing. After coming to
                this realization, I felt kind of lost. I had spent most of my life thinking this was the path I was
                going to go on, and while that was naive, at the time my younger self felt lost. As I eased into
                highschool and got acclimated to this new experience, I started to get more and more interested in
                Computer Science and Web Design. </p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Most of the things I take inspiration from when it comes to Web Design are early 2000s and 90s
                aesthetics. I like the more old school design style of websites, taking inspiration from borderline
                tacky, flashy and blingy visual styles. I also really enjoy the exact opposite of this: minimalism. I
                enjoy very modern looking design for websites, ones that embrace brutalism or minimalist designs. The
                art work I displayed in the gallery above depicts some of the aesthetics and designs I pull for
                inspiration when it comes to design. Furthermore, this website describes just one of the art styles I
                find myself interested in. I cannot wait toexplore more aspects of design throughout my career in Web
                Design.</p>
